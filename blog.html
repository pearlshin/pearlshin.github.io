            <p>Watching Shereef's Fireside Chat made me realize how my perspective of web development has changed over the years. I am excited to be a part of a culture with people striving for a "kitchen" mindset that will mold us not only into better web developers, but better learners as well. <a href="http://pearlshin.github.io/blog/c1-chefs-kitchen.html"><strong>Continue reading...</strong></a></p>

          <img src="http://placekitten.com/g/600/800">
            <p>Everyone has panicked at least once in their lifetime over losing changes he or she made to a file or saving the wrong changes. You don't have to worry about losing data with version control because it keeps tracks of all the changes you made to a file. <a href="http://pearlshin.github.io/blog/t1-git-blog.html"><strong>Continue reading...</strong></a></p>

          <img src="http://placekitten.com/g/600/800">
            <p>Arrays and hashes are both collections of objects, but are retrieved in slightly different ways. Let's first look at the syntax of an array and hash using the same collection of objects. You would write an array like so: <a href="http://pearlshin.github.io/blog/t4-arrays-hashes.html"><strong>Continue reading...</strong></a></p>

        <h3><a href="http://pearlshin.github.io/blog/c3_thinking-style.html">Applying My Thinking Style To DBC</a></h3>
          <img src="http://placekitten.com/g/600/800">
            <p>I have always known that I preferred structured environments where deadlines are met, instructions are clear and assignments are completed thoroughly.

          <img src="http://placekitten.com/g/600/800">
