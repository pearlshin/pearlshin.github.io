        <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
        <p>Pair programming is when two developers collaborate to work on something together. With respect, courtesy and an open mind, pairing allows for an extra set of eyes to catch errors. Pairing also involves input from both developers so that they can combine their understandings together and learn more than they would have if they were working alone. </p>

        <h2>Why is Pair Programming Important to DBC?</h2>
        <p>It is important to DBC because everyone can benefit when the driver and navigator share their knowledge with each other. If one pair lacks understanding more than the other, the other pair can teach or mentor. Both benefit because teaching or explaining something clearly solidifies your knowledge while the other gains the pair's knowledge. </p>

        <h2 id="last-box">Role of Driver &amp; Navigator</h2>
        <p>While there are many ways to be a driver or navigator, the driver typically types code while the navigator leads the driver. Both are expected to give input and both should focus on the area of code that the navigator is instructing.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>I didn't have a pair to work with so I ended up pairing with my guide. I was a bit intimidated to pair with someone who was supposed to be the instructor, but the experience turned out to be much better than expected. It was a good way to better understand CSS concepts I wasn't too sure about before. Padding, for example, was something I didn't know how to use comfortably. When my pair suggested I use something to push my text inside the column bars, I saw how padding can be very helpful when I want to adjust the content inside a container. We were able to end with the basic structure of the page and I worked on adding more styling elements to the page afterwards.</p>
