          <p class="text">Pair Programming was one of my fears at Devbootcamp because I knew I wouldn't feel comfortable speaking and contributing when I wasn't sure of something. Feeling behind with a partner and an instructor watching us during GPSs was also something I felt intimidated by. However, pair programming became a new and interesting experience. Everyone I have paired with has been patient, cooperative and receptive to my input even if it was wrong. This helped me to learn a lot more than I had expected and the most helpful part of pair programming for me has been seeing how other people would solve a challenge. While I have a specific way I would go about a problem, listening to my pair's input has always brought me to a better understanding of a concept or taught me a more concise way to solve it. The most difficult part of pair programming (other than my own difficulties speaking up more often) has been talking about driving and navigating roles. Both my pairs and I have always been willing to be either role and I have always forgotten to switch roles during the challenge. Timeboxing is also another issue I've run into a few times, but I'm confident that these issues will go away with more practice. <br>
          I am grateful for everyone's feedback because I felt like they were respectful and honest. Every pair I've had has given me thorough explanations of what he or she felt like I needed to work on more and what went well during our session. Based on the feedback I've received so far, I will continue to take in the other person's input and stay open to trying different ways to solve the problem. This has helped us understand why our approaches did or didn't work. The improvements I will need to work on are related to the struggles I mentioned earlier in the post. Enforcing driver/navigator roles and switching off is something I will need to become more vocal about as well as keeping my pair updated with what is on my screen.<br>
          I initially felt hesitant while writing feedback at the start of pair programming because I didn't feel as though there major problems that my pair needed to work on. I wanted to let them know that I learned a lot and appreciated our session and if I did have anything I felt like my partner should work on, I felt that I needed to work on them too.<br>
