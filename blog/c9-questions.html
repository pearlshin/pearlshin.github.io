          <p class="text">I haven't asked many questions in the Google + community, but I found it very useful for the few times that I have. For one the challenges in the beginning of phase 0, I was having issues with passing an rspec test. It was a very basic problem so I was pretty confident that my solutions were correct, but I couldn't be too sure with the tests failing. I posted my solution in the community chat and copy and pasted what the error message was telling me. Others responded that they were having the same issues and one of the administraters later announced a change to fetch for the particular challenge. I found that it is helpful to be very specific about where you are having problems and the error messages that you receive. Explaining how you went about a problem carefully step by step is always easier for the person reading to follow along and understand where you could have made an error. I have also benefited from others asking specific questions about their code that not only ask others how to make their code work, but in ways that help them understand a concept better. <br>
          Generally, I found the questions on Stack Overflow with specific problems named in the title and expanded in the body very helpful. I tended to skip the problems with too much code in the questions, but when people posted snippets of code that produced problems, it was easier to follow along. I find that copying and pasting the entire program makes it tiring to read and easy to skip over.<br>
