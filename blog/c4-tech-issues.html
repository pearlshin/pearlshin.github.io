          <p class="text">  The lack of women in the tech field is what came to my mind immediately while reading the assignment for this blog post. As a woman, I can't help but think about the underrepresentation of minorities and women and the struggles that they face in the tech industry. Statistics show that women only make up <a href="https://medium.com/matter/this-is-the-last-thing-youll-ever-need-to-read-about-sexism-in-tech-56b9a3a77af0">25% of the tech industry</a> and from what I've read a lot online, many attribute the low percentage of women as a pipeline problem. Apparently, there aren't enough women who are interested in technology but there is also a significant dropout rate (57%) of them leaving the field. Many women who enter the tech field love their work and want to fit in, but a slight or major offense or harassment, can easily create a barrier and contribute to the large drop out rate. The problem seems to be the perspective that these offensive jokes are not meant to be taken seriously and unintended to be harmful, but in reality, it fosters a sexist culture. This has nothing to do with women being more vulnerable or sensitive than men, it is simply about creating an environment where everyone is equally respected. Crude jokes and behavior should not come at the expense of women or anyone, period.
          <br><br> Coming from a school where asians only represent 6.8% of the student population (and 62.5% are white), I understand the intimidation of enterting a place where you stand out as the minority. The natural approach almost anyone would take is to fit in, but it can sometimes come at the expensive of your race, gender, or whatever it is that defines you as the minority.
          <br><br> Potential solutions would definitely involve starting with young children. Exposing young students to their interests regardless of what is typically gender specific and implementing programming into the school curriculum are possible solutions that I think would address the lack of diversity and gender issues for the future. But solutions for women who are already in the field facing these issues would be to continue emphasizing the importance of gender issues. I think the awareness of these issues are apparent, but as long as organizations continue to enforce it's seriousness, people will see that it is an issue that affects everyone. I value the rise of coding schools and organizations that provide education and resources catered towards women, but I think all coding schools and organizations should strive to create a network of empowered women <em>and</em> men who want to build their skills. Diminishing the perspective that gender issues are two opposing perspectives that are always at a clash with each other would lessen the pressure on men to be "brogrammers" and on women to succumb to stereotype threats.
