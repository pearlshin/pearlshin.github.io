            Because conflicts make me extremely uncomfortable, I usually avoid them as much as possible. In the event where I do find myself in a conflict, I typically cannot shake off the discomfort and cannot focus on anything else until the conflict is resolved.<br><br>
            There have been plenty of experiences in my fashion internship where there were personality clashes in high pressure situations, such as making sure every piece of jewelry and clothing has come in and been recorded for an important photo shoot. As most can probably imagine, it's difficult to keep track of every earring, shoe, tie, clip, dress, etc out of the multiple racks of clothing there. The majority expressed their concerns and frustrations by vocalizing them and showing urgency in their words and actions. I, on the other hand, did the complete opposite which lead people to think I was being cold or uninterested in the matter at hand. Personally, I thought fixing the current urgency by focusing on how to resolve the issue would be more effective than expressing it, especially when time was crucial. This lead to many miscommunications between me and another intern who I was closely working with at the time. Because I enjoyed what I was doing but felt unfit for the culture, I began to have negative thoughts about myself and found myself strongly feeling out of place.<br><br>
            In both our minds, the other was at fault and could handle the situation better. However, after countless misunderstandings, I was forced to confront her and explain what was going on in my mind. Surprisingly, my confrontation helped her understand the way I handled stressful situations and working together became much more pleasant. I learned that as much as confrontation is uncomfortable, it is sometimes necessary. I think confrontation was the best approach to the situation, but if I could go back, I would be more mindful of the way I might come off to others. I'm not the type of person to be expressive of my feelings with new people, but I should definitely make more of an effort to be more clear of where I stand and what I'm thinking.
