          <p class="text">Ruby is an object oriented programming language that use classes and objects. Classes are like blueprints for creating objects. I'll use a violin as an example in object-oriented terms. A violin is an instance of the class of objects known as instruments. The strings, bridge, fine tuners, chinrest, pegbox, scroll, and long neck are a few charactersistics of the violin that make it a violin. There are different functions you can do with the violin such as running the bow on the string or plucking them. A class is a combination of characteristics and functions of an object(s).<br>
          Instance variables are variables that are available for methods within the class. Instance variables are preceded by the "@" sign and are defined in the initialize method. A method is like a recipe that tells you what you need (instance variables that you may need) and what it produces. To make this into a class structure, it would look like this: <br><br>

          Class Instrument<br>
          <br>  def initialize
          <br>    @violin = violin
          <br>    @flute = flute
          <br>  end <br>

          <br>  def string_instrument

          <br>  end <br>


          <br>  def woodwind_instrument

          <br>  end <br>

          <br> end <br>

          v = Instrument.new <br>
