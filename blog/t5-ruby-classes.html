          <p class="text">Ruby is an object oriented programming language that use classes and objects. Classes are like blueprints for creating objects. I'll use a person's information as an example in object-oriented terms. A "name" is an instance of the class of objects known as a "person". The name, age, and birthday are a few charactersistics of the person that define him or her. There are different functions you can do with the information that the parameter takes in. A class is essentially a combination of characteristics and functions of an object(s).<br>
          Instance variables are variables that are available for methods within the class. Instance variables are preceded by the "@" sign and are defined in the initialize method. A method is like a recipe that tells you what you need (instance variables that you may need) and what it produces. <br><br>

          class Person<br>
          <br>  def initialize(name, age, birthday)
          <br>    @name = name
          <br>    @age = age
          <br>    @birthday = birthday
          <br>  end <br>

          <br>  def intro
                puts "Hello! My name is #{@name}, I am #{@age} years old, and my birthday is #{birthday}."
          <br>  end <br>

          <br> end <br>

          pearl = Person.new("pearl", "24", "februrary 18th, 1990") <br><br>

          Whenever you want to put a new person in the person class, you create a new object of the class by writing the class name followed by ".new" and parenthesis containing the name, age, and birthday.
