        <h2><strong>The Difference Between Margin, Border, and Padding</strong><h2>
          <p class="date">September 28th, 2014</p>
          <p class="tags"></p>
          <p class="text">Margins, borders, and paddings are CSS properties you can use for HTML elements on your page. To take it one more step back, HTML elements are what webpages are made out of and CSS is what you use to style them. For example, the fonts, colors, sizes and structures that you see on a webpage are all CSS properties that style the fonts, shapes, sizes, etc. So if you have an image that you want to put on a webpage, margins, borders and paddings are properties that style the image.
            <img src="Desktop/box-model.jpg">
          As you can see from the image, margins, borders and paddings are the amount of space between each other. However, there are several differences. Padding is the space inside the box whereas margin is space outside of the box. The size of the margin affects how far away it will be from other elements on the webpage, and not necessarily the top, bottom or sides of the entire webpage. The border acts as the outline of the content.
