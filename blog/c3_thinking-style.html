        <h2><strong>Applying My Thinking Style To DBC</strong><h2>

            I have always known that I preferred structured environments where deadlines are met, instructions are clear and assignments are completed thoroughly. It didn't come as a surprise to me when my results showed that I am a concrete sequential thinker who tends to like order, logical sequence, and getting facts. I worried about whether being a concrete sequential thinker would be a major setback for a place like DBC or not. However, as I become better at vocalizing my thought process, hopefully it will be beneficial to present an understanding of something in an organized, step-by-step manner to somebody else.  <br><br>


            After researching time management, productivity and mindfulness during week 1, I realized that my preference for structure came from a need to feel productive. I noticed that I get carried away with getting something done more than I focus on how much I am actually learning. Reading about the fixed and growth mindset and learning about DBC's culture where community, communication, and personal growth is just as important as learning how to code inspired me to embrace the fear of the unknown and how I will grow intellectually and personally over the next few months. Despite our differences in learning styles and how much we may know something, I saw that we all have something unique to offer to bring an understanding of something in a different way or a greater extent. <br><br>


            My biggest struggles at DBC so far has been pair programming and solving problems with some creativity and that there are various ways to get the same answer. There isn't always one particular way to solve a problem; there are a plethora of ways to go about a challenge, some being more efficient than others. It has been a little difficult following verbal instructions during pairing sessions and I tend to rely on examples and step-by-by instructions, but I have also surprisingly found myself enjoying the process of solving a challenge anyway. Pairing with someone on a challenge that I have already worked on showed me better ways to solve the problem and as a result, my knowledge solidified. Working on these Ruby challenges is something new for me and it's definitely exercising my brain, but trying to think with a growth mindset will hopefully continue to expand my thinking style and perspective of coding from someone who has never had any coding experience. One of the main ways I've recognized as crucial in broadening the way I learn is to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. Rather than stressing over getting everything done, I will work on solidifying what I learn. <br><br>
