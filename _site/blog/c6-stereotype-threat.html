        <h2><strong>Stereotype Threats</strong><h2>

          <p class="text">During my middle school to high school years, many asians began to move into my school district and populated a large percent of the schools. Because many asian americans excelled academically in almost all subjects, I always considered myself to be below average in asian academic standards. As I mentioned in my Tech Problems blog post, I then attended a college where asians only represented 6% of the population and the majority was white. While I never felt immense pressure to excel because of my ethnicity, I did see the effort to address stereotype threats in my college. I have seen programs such as HEOP (the higher education program) and the Posse Foundation partnered between New York state and individual colleges and universities to provide economical and educational disadvantaged students the opportunity for a college education. This program consisted of mostly black, hispanic, and asian students during my four years but I know they consist of a variety of people from different backgrounds in different schools. By choosing high school students who have high academic and leadership potential but may be overlooked by traditional college application processes, these programs exist to create a supportive environment where these students can have the means to meet or go beyond their potentials. <br><br>
I knew students from these programs who excelled quite successfully, were aware of possibly being viewed through the lens of racial stereotypes and never let it affect them socially or academically. Having friends who worked diligently despite "the salience of the stereotypes group identity" (Reducing Stereotype Threat) always motivated me to not let the pressure of being good at math or being an overachiever as an asian american get to me as much. In my personal experiences, I realized that sometimes we place the pressure of feeling a stereotype threat on ourselves. When you are in the minority, the pressure to not validate a stereotype comes naturally. However, I found that focusing on yourself as an individual and reminding yourself to not view yourself through the lens of racial stereotypes also allows you to perform based on the potentials you see within yourself rather than allowing any pressure to influence it. <br><br>

When I suspect that someone may be feeling a stereotype threat, I think it's important to interact with that person in a way that shows that you view them for who they are as an individual. You react and take action based on your perspective, so if you view someone through a stereotype lens, it will show in your words and actions. When you are part of a community, I think it's essential that you remember that we are all in the same boat regardless of the differences in background, skill level, learning paces, etc. There are a variety of ways to benefit from one another in a community of diverse people. Meeting everyone with patience, respect, and kindness regardless of that person's background will break down any barriers and allow each individual to rise to his or her potential without added pressures and stereotype threats. </br></p>
