        <h2><strong>DBC Impressions</strong><h2>
          <p class="date">September 24th, 2014</p>

          <p class="text">Watching Shereef's Fireside Chat made me realize how my perspective of web development has changed over the years. I am excited to be a part of a culture with people striving for a "kitchen" mindset that will mold us not only into better web developers, but better learners as well. <br>Before watching the video, I already knew that the DBC experience would be different from most structures of learning and that we will have to learn as quickly and as much as possible on our own two feet. With technology rapidly growing and evolving, I appreciate that DBC aims to teach their students by encouraging them to teach themselves. Having a job in this field will require us to learn and keep up as technology continues to advance over time. On the other hand, as much as I see the need to be self-sufficient yet reliable, resourceful and communicative to others, I worry that I won't be able to keep up or learn as quickly as the majority of the group. I want to be just as useful and reliable to my cohort members as much as possible.</br></p>
