Values and morals are important foundations for our perspectives and actions. They are what influence what we see and consequently, we act upon our views. I often remind myself that these values and morals must be my grounding despite how busy life gets and no matter how much I want to accomplish. Because without them, thoughts and actions go unchecked. Sooner or later, nothing will be as meaningful if what I've become on the inside has spoiled.<br><br>
I can't say that I live up to each value to the fullest extent everyday, but I definitely try my best to and plan on extending that effort into DBC. Since DBC emphasizes the importance of pair programming and team work, I look forward to building relationships with others in a supportive environment. Being in an open and supportive environment has always enabled me to try harder in fulfilling my responsibilities and helping others whenever and however possible. I feel more accomplished when I contribute something into group work because the work and relationships become more meaningful.<br><br>
As I mentioned in my <a href="http://pearlshin.github.io/blog/c6-stereotype-threat.html">stereotype threat post</a>, focusing on myself and others as individuals, I believe, will enable me to handle stereotype threats. These values are the important things to focus on with an individual and I believe we should value others for their values.
